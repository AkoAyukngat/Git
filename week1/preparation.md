And we'll be roughly following the materials here:  https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Git/blob/git-improvements/week1/review.md

As a preparation for Sunday's class, it would be great if you'd do the following before the class:
 1. create an account on github (github.com)
 2. install git
    - for mac users, running `brew install git` on the command line should work;
    - for ubuntu people (or any debian based linux), run  `sudo apt-get install git` on the command line
    - for windows people: download the Git for Windows Setup in https://git-scm.com/download/win and install. Step by step instructions:
        1. execute the file you downloaded
        2. n the Information screen, click next
        3. On the Select components screen, click next without changing anything
        4. Choosing the default editor used by Git, select Use Vim and click next
        5. Adjusting your path environment, select Use Git from Git Bash only and click next
        6. Choosing HTTPS transport backend, select Use the OpenSSL library and click next
        7. Configuring the line ending conversions, select Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings and click next
        8.  Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash, select Use MinTTY and click next
        9.  Configuring extra options, select Enable file system caching and Enable Git Credential manager, click next
        10. Configuring experimental options, do not select any of them, and click install
        11. You should be pretty much done :slightly_smiling_face:
