# Homework

In this exercise you will practice what you learned in class about commiting your changes and pushing them to Github. Here are the instructions:

1. Inside the folder `hyf-homework/git/week1` create a new file named `my_favorite_food.txt`, inside the file write your favorite food recipe, and commit your changes (you can just find a random recipe on google and paste it in the file ;) ).
2. Again inside the folder `hyf-homework/git/week1` add a new file named `my_second_favorite_food.txt`, inside the file write the recipe for your second favorite food, and commit your changes.
3. Inside the folder `hyf-homework/git/week1` create a third file named `countries.txt`, where you list three countries that you have visited (this doesn't need to be true, you can just write the names of three random countries), and commit your changes.
4. Push your changes into your `hyf-homework` repository on github.
5. **On your computer** add a fourth country name to the file `countries.txt`, and commit your changes again.
6. **On github**, add also a fourth country name to the file `countries.txt`, and commit your changes there.
7. Push your local changes into your `hyf-homework` repository on github (and now it will not be that easy :) ).


Commands that you will need:
 - `git add <file_name>` - tell git to start tracking a file and to update what will be commited
 - `git commit -m "commit_message"` - commit (save) your changes
 - `git push origin master` - push (upload) your changes into your github repository into the branch master.
 - `git pull origin master` - pull (download) your changes into your github repository into the branch master.


Useful git commands:
  - `git status`  - this is your best friend when you are using git :)
  - `git log`
  - `git log --oneline`


Command line commands that might be useful:
 - `pwd`- print working directory, to know where you are 
 - `cd <folder_name>` - to go inside folder_name
 - `cd ..`- to go to the parent folder of your current folder
 - `mkdir <folder_name>` - to create a new folder
 - `ls`- list all the folder contents
 - `ls .*` - list all the folder contents, also invisible folders/files (e.g. the git folder)
