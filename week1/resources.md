Here are a few resources that might be useful:

 - a quick overview of git: https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/;
 - a beginner's tutorial: http://ryanflorence.com/git-for-beginners/. It covers pretty much the same stuff we covered in class in the "basic workflow" part, we didn't get to the "advanced workflow" part though;
 - a simple git guide: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/;
 - an interactive tutorial: https://learngitbranching.js.org/. The relevant parts for you are in the "Main" section, introduction sequence, part 1, and in the "Remote" section, the full "Push & Pull" sequence. Feel free to do the other parts if you want :). You can also go to https://learngitbranching.js.org/?NODEMO if you want to just play around;
 - the Pro Git book: https://git-scm.com/om/book/en/v2 , you'll find pretty much everything about git there, but might be tedious :);
 - a visual git guide, this is a bit advanced: http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html;
 - a list of some graphical interfaces for git: https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis;
 - for when things really go wrong: https://ohshitgit.com/ (be careful using this!).
