# Homework

Here goes the homework, the idea is just to repeat what you did yesterday to get more practice working in teams using github. For the homework I will be your pair, and  the idea is again that you fork a repository, clone it, do some changes in the code in a separate branch (not on master!) and then push these changes into github. Don't forget to solve any conflicts that might occur! :slightly_smiling_face:

Here are the instructions
1. fork this repository: `https://github.com/martamatos/git_advanced_class_homework.git`
2. on  github, add me as a collaborator, github username: martamatos
3. clone your forked repository into your computer
4. create a branch add_division and go to it
5. in the file math.js add a function to divide two numbers at the end of the file. the function should take two numbers as arguments (e.g., a and b) and return the result of their division (e.g. a/b)
6. tell me when you're done with the previous steps, so that i can change the master branch, and *please don't continue the homework until i say you can*
7. update your local master branch
8. go to the add_division branch and merge the master branch with it
9. push your add_division branch into github
10. on github, do a pull request of your add_divion branch into the master branchr
