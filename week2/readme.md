start with basic git push and branching

start with a repo with readme and a javascript file with one function

me:
- fork, add a collaborator, create a branch, add a file, push branch, do pull request

students:
part 1:
- fork my repo
- one adds the other as collaborator
- each create a branch, add a file with js function, push branch, do pull request

part 2:
-  each create a branch, add function at the end of the file, push branch, do pull request
- fix conflict

talk about:
- git stash
- git diff
- git checkout
- git rm
